## Heart Disease Prediction System
-> Developed a machine learning model using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forest to predict 10-year heart disease risk, achieving the highest accuracy of 0.97 with Random Forest.

-> Processed data from 4,240 individuals, handling missing values, standardizing metrics, and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets to ensure model reliability.

-> Implemented data preprocessing techniques including imputation of missing values and normalization to enhance model performance.

-> Evaluated model performance using confusion matrix, precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy metrics, ensuring robust and reliable predictions.

-> Integrated the predictive model into a Flask web application, enabling users to input health data and receive real-time risk assessments.

-> Developed a user-friendly interface in Flask for easy data input and clear presentation of prediction results.

-> Conducted comprehensive feature analysis to identify key health indicators influencing heart disease risk, improving model accuracy and interpretability.

-> Provided actionable insights based on model predictions to support preventive healthcare measures and informed decision-making.
